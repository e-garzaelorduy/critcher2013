# Replicating Critcher et al. (2013): How Quick Decisions Illuminate Moral Character

This repository is part of the Psych204 coursework at UC San Diego. The objective is to replicate a research paper using the methods and techniques learned in the course. For this project, I have chosen to replicate the findings from the paper *How Quick Decisions Illuminate Moral Character* by Clayton R. Critcher, Yoel Inbar, and David A. Pizarro (2013).

## About

This repository is currently in its initial stages and will be populated with the code, data, and documentation required to replicate the key findings of Critcher et al. (2013) as the course progresses. The paper explores how quick decisions can reveal moral character, with a focus on traits such as honesty and trustworthiness.

## Project Overview

### Research Title: Replication of *How Quick Decisions Illuminate Moral Character* by Clayton R. Critcher, Yoel Inbar, and David A. Pizarro (2013)

**Description**:  
This project aims to replicate the study *How Quick Decisions Illuminate Moral Character* by Critcher et al. (2013), focusing on how quick judgments about moral character are made based on various social traits. The replication follows the methodology and experimental design outlined in the original paper, with analysis to be conducted in R.

**Purpose**:  
The primary objectives of this replication are to:
- Validate the robustness of the findings from Critcher et al. (2013).
- Apply statistical techniques and replication methods learned in Psych204.

## Usage

### Replication Process

As the course progresses, this repository will include the necessary scripts, datasets, and analysis workflows.

## Methods Overview

This replication project follows the experimental design and methodology of Critcher et al. (2013), which examined how quick decisions about moral character are formed. The original study focused on traits such as honesty, trustworthiness, and their influence on rapid moral judgments.

### Key Methods:

- Experimental design using vignettes to assess moral evaluations.
- Linear models to test predictors of moral character judgments.

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are not expected for this course project. However, if youâ€™d like to suggest improvements or replicate additional findings from Critcher et al. (2013), feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
